# miRepress
A model for predicting human target protein repression level considering new classes of microRNA targets
miRepress comes with a Java Swing user interface
You will need Java Runtime Environment 1.7 (or greater) to run miRepress

To use miRepress:
Download the release mirepress_v1.1 and extract
Open the folder mirepress_v1.1 and then open miRepress.jar, the user interface will open
Give the target gene id or mRNA accession number in the textfield, give the human microRNA name (e.g. miR-1) and then click submit
The predicted target repression score will be displayed in a separate window along with a table showing predicted miR-target interactions
Upon clicking the "OK" button you will be directed back to the initial window
