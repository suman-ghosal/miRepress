# miRepress
A model for predicting human target protein repression level considering new classes of microRNA targets
<br>
miRepress comes with a Java Swing user interface
<br>
You will need Java Runtime Environment 1.7 (or greater) to run miRepress
<p>
To use miRepress:
<br>
Download the release mirepress_v1.1 and extract
<br>
Open the folder mirepress_v1.1 and then open miRepress.jar, the user interface will open
<br>
Give the target gene id or mRNA accession number in the textfield, give the human microRNA name (e.g. miR-1) and then click submit
<br>
The predicted target repression score will be displayed in a separate window along with a table showing predicted miR-target interactions
<br>
Upon clicking the "OK" button you will be directed back to the initial window
